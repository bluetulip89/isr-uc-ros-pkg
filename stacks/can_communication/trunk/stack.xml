  <description brief="can_communication">
	
	This stack is intended to provide an abstraction layer for a CAN bus in ROS.
	One of the main features is the can_usb_adapters pkg which holds hardware drivers for multiple CAN USB adapters, allowing you to switch adapters while keeping your ROS CAN code working.
