  <description brief="Nodes for relaying to a foreign master.">
    The foreign_relay node is designed for use with multiple robots running
    separate masters. It is like a relay, except that it additionally
    registers its topic on a foreign master. The unreliable_relay node is like 
    relay in topic_tools except that it requests an unreliable transport.
